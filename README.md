# BakeryWebsite #

## Short website's description ##

This website aims to create an online
shop to allow customers to buy products online and
expand the bakery, allowing people to learn
more about the company. The website shows a logo image at
the top-left corner and 3 buttons (Contact, Products, Basket
icon) at the top-right corner. However, at the bottom of every
HTML file I created, we can find the opening hours of bakeries.

## Main page (index.html) ##

The main page of this website presents a small description of
the company, explaining what the bakery is known for and how
long it has been in business. I made that using p as a
paragraph and h as headings. Below the text, we can see 2 
images presenting the owners, with a small description below.
